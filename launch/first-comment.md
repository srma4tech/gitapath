Hi Product Hunt community, I am the maker of **GitaPath**. Thank you for checking it out.

I built this because many people want to read the Bhagavad Gita daily but struggle with consistency. Most tools are either too heavy or not focused on small daily practice.

What GitaPath does:
- Shows one verse per day from all 700 verses
- Includes Sanskrit, transliteration, Hindi and English meanings
- Adds a short reflection for practical application
- Tracks streaks so daily discipline becomes easier
- Works offline after first visit as an installable PWA

Why this approach:
- One verse a day is realistic
- Reflection keeps it practical, not just informational
- No login, no backend, no distractions

If you try it, I would love feedback on:
1. Verse readability and language toggles
2. Share card design and utility
3. What would help you stay consistent for 108 days

Also, yes, you can schedule Product Hunt launch in advance. I prepared this launch to go live at a time when most of my audience is active.

Thank you again for your support.
