      <h2 class="mb-3 text-2xl text-gp-goldSoft">Why the Bhagavad Gita Still Matters</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        The Bhagavad Gita is a dialogue on duty, inner clarity, and spiritual intelligence. It appears in the Mahabharata at a decisive moment where Arjuna, a capable warrior, loses confidence and becomes emotionally overwhelmed. He stands between two armies, unable to act, confused about what is right, and fearful of the consequences of action. Lord Krishna responds not with a shortcut, but with a complete framework for living. That framework remains relevant because modern people face the same internal struggle: uncertainty, attachment, stress, and conflict between values and obligations.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        The Gita does not ask readers to abandon life. It teaches how to live responsibly, act with integrity, and remain inwardly steady while fulfilling everyday roles. Whether someone is a student, professional, parent, creator, or caretaker, the text offers a language for discipline without harshness, devotion without dogma, and purpose without ego. That is why people return to it daily. It can be studied philosophically, practiced devotionally, or applied pragmatically in decision-making.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mb-3 mt-8 text-2xl text-gp-goldSoft">Core Teachings in Simple Terms</h2>
      <h3 class="mb-2 text-xl text-gp-goldSoft/95">1. Dharma: Right Action in Your Present Role</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        Dharma in the Gita is not abstract morality. It is context-aware responsibility. Krishna guides Arjuna toward action aligned with duty, ethics, and the welfare of society. For modern readers, dharma means doing what is right in the role you currently hold, even when that action is difficult. It asks for courage and clarity, not perfection.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mb-2 text-xl text-gp-goldSoft/95">2. Karma Yoga: Work Without Egoic Attachment</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        Karma Yoga is one of the most practical contributions of the Gita. You are asked to give full effort but not collapse emotionally around outcomes. This does not mean indifference. It means mature engagement where action is an offering, not an attempt to control everything. Performance improves when anxiety decreases, and anxiety decreases when identity is not chained to result.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mb-2 text-xl text-gp-goldSoft/95">3. Jnana and Bhakti: Wisdom and Devotion Together</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        The Gita does not force a choice between reason and devotion. It integrates both. Jnana clarifies who you are beyond unstable thoughts and emotional turbulence. Bhakti softens the heart and anchors intention in humility and trust. When wisdom and devotion come together, life becomes less reactive and more compassionate.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mb-2 text-xl text-gp-goldSoft/95">4. Mind Discipline: Steadiness Through Practice</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        The mind is acknowledged as both friend and challenge. Krishna recommends repeated practice, moderation, attention, and return to focus. In modern language, this is a process model: do not expect instant transformation. Build small habits. Observe drift. Return gently. Over time, stability becomes natural.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mb-3 mt-8 text-2xl text-gp-goldSoft">How to Read the Gita Without Getting Overwhelmed</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        Many readers stop because they try to consume too much too quickly. A better approach is daily contact with one verse, one meaning, and one reflection. Ask a single practical question: “How does this verse apply to the next decision I will make today?” This keeps study actionable. The point is transformation in behavior, not accumulation of quotations.
      </p>
      <ul class="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 text-white/90">
        <li>Read one verse at a fixed time daily.</li>
        <li>Review Sanskrit, transliteration, and meaning slowly.</li>
        <li>Write one line on real-life application.</li>
        <li>Track consistency so practice becomes identity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        GitaPath is designed for this exact rhythm. The app gives one daily verse with Hindi and English meaning, plus a reflection prompt and streak tracking. This structure reduces decision fatigue. You do not need to plan what to read; you only need to show up.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mb-3 mt-8 text-2xl text-gp-goldSoft">A Living Text, Not a One-Time Read</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        The Bhagavad Gita is often read repeatedly because the reader changes over time. A verse that looked philosophical at age twenty may feel deeply practical at age forty. A teaching that once sounded strict may later feel compassionate. Repetition is not redundancy; it is deepening. Each cycle of life reveals new nuances in the same text.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        If you are beginning now, start gently and stay regular. If you already know the text, revisit it with fresh attention. In both cases, the highest value comes from consistent practice, not intensity spikes. The Gita invites daily alignment, not occasional inspiration.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mb-3 mt-8 text-2xl text-gp-goldSoft">How to Approach the 18 Chapters Over Time</h2>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        A useful long-term method is to treat the 18 chapters as a progressive curriculum. Early chapters often help readers stabilize emotional confusion and understand duty. Middle chapters deepen practice through devotion, discipline, and discernment. Later chapters integrate knowledge and action into a unified life approach. You do not need to force this structure in one pass. Let it emerge gradually as you maintain daily contact.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-white/90">
        If a chapter feels dense, stay with it longer rather than rushing ahead. Repetition builds familiarity, and familiarity builds insight. Keep a short journal with three lines: key verse, practical takeaway, and one behavior change. After a few weeks, review your notes. You will notice that recurring teachings are not repetitive by accident; they are reinforcing the foundations of a stable inner life.
      </p>
